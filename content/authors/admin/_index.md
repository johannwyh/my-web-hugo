I am a Ph.D. student of SCSE, Nanyang Technological University. I am a member of [NTU MMLab](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/) and advised by [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/). My current research lies in face manipulation, AI generation and machine learning on graphs.

Before joining NTU, I earned my bachelor degree from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I had some wonderful research experience in [ZJU-ZLST](http://eagle.zju.edu.cn/researchfield-4-4/), [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open/home) and [NCSU ARoS](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/). I worked closely with [Prof. Sheng Zhou](https://zhoushengisnoob.github.io/) and [Prof. Can Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wangcan#775614) from ZJU, and [Ying Tai](https://tyshiwo.github.io/) and Junwei Zhu from Tencent Youtu.

I am also an ACMer, participated in 6 ACM ICPC/CCPC Asia Regional Contest, won 4 gold medals and 2 silver medals.
