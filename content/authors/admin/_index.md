I am Yuhan Wang (王宇晗), currently a Senior Researcher at [Hunyuan, Tencent](https://hunyuan.tencent.com/visual), where I work on 3D generation foundation models for [Hunyuan3D](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/). I am also completing my Ph.D. in [College of Computing and Data Science](https://hongfz16.github.io/), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), affiliated with [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), advised by [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/). My current research interests are in 3D representation and generation.

During my industry research internships, I am honored to have worked with [Zeyu Hu](https://hzykent.github.io/), [Weikai Chen](https://chenweikai.github.io/), and [Xin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Z1GJ50AAAAJ&hl=en) at [LightSpeed Studios](https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/), and with [Ying Tai](https://tyshiwo.github.io/) and [Junwei Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-OxQlHsAAAAJ) at [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open/home). Before NTU, I earned my bachelor's degree from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I participated in six ACM ICPC/CCPC Asia Regional Contests, earning four gold medals and two silver medals.
