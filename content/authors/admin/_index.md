My name is spelled 王宇晗 in Chinese. 

I am a Ph.D. student in the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University. I am a member of [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), advised by [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/). My current research lies in 3D generation, human generation and video generation. I am currently a research intern at [LightSpeed Studios](https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/), working with [Zeyu Hu](https://hzykent.github.io/), [Weikai Chen](https://chenweikai.github.io/), and [Xin Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-wang-%E7%8E%8B%E9%91%AB-a3075375/) on 3D generation related topics.

Before joining NTU, I earned my bachelor degree from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I had some wonderful research experience in [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open/home) with [Dr. Ying Tai](https://tyshiwo.github.io/) and [Junwei Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-OxQlHsAAAAJ). I am also an ACMer, participated in six ACM ICPC/CCPC Asia Regional Contest, with four gold medals and two silver medals.
